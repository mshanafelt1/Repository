      <p>Hello my name is Michael Shanafelt. I was born in South Africa but I grew up here in the United States. I spent the majority of my childhood years in Tallahassee, Florida while my father was teaching at Florida State. When I was 13 we moved to Georgia because my dad got another teaching job at a different school. After 4 years of high school I moved to Atlanta to attend college at Georgia State University. I have been here for about 10 years now. I am currently learning how to code at Georgia Tech Coding bootcamp and I am enjoying what I have done thus far. <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">www.lipsum.com</a></p>
